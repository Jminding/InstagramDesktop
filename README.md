# Instagram Desktop App
Instagram Website ported to Desktop through Electron JS

# How to Use
1. Download proper application for your computer (.app for macOS, .exe for Windows, .AppImage for Linux)
2. Open Application (if you see any warning about the application being unverified, just press open anyway or similar, this warning comes as a result of this being made by me)

# Toggling Dark Mode
When opened, it will be on Dark Mode (by default)
To switch it to Light Mode, go to View > Toggle Light Mode
To go back to Dark Mode, go to View > Toggle Dark Mode
